# App Icon Setup Instructions

## Setup Complete âœ…

I've configured `flutter_launcher_icons` in your `pubspec.yaml` with the following settings:

```yaml
flutter_launcher_icons:
  android: true
  ios: true
  image_path: "assets/images/logo.png"
  adaptive_icon_background: "#66BB6A"  # Primary green color
  adaptive_icon_foreground: "assets/images/logo.png"
  remove_alpha_ios: true
```

## What You Need to Do:

### Step 1: Save Your Logo
1. Take the green logo image you want to use
2. Save it as **`logo.png`**
3. Place it in: `assets/images/logo.png`

**Requirements:**
- Size: At least **1024x1024 pixels** (recommended)
- Format: PNG (transparent or solid background)

### Step 2: Generate Icons
Once the logo is saved, run:

```bash
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

This will automatically generate all required icon sizes for:
- **Android**: mipmap-hdpi, mipmap-mdpi, mipmap-xhdpi, mipmap-xxhdpi, mipmap-xxxhdpi
- **Android Adaptive Icons**: Foreground + Background
- **iOS**: All required icon sizes

### Step 3: Rebuild Your App
```bash
flutter clean
flutter run
```

## Icon Configuration Details

### Android
- **Standard Icons**: Generated from your logo
- **Adaptive Icons**: 
  - Background: Solid green (#66BB6A - your primary brand color)
  - Foreground: Your logo image
  - This creates a modern Android 8+ icon with dynamic shapes

### iOS
- **App Icon**: Generated from your logo
- **Alpha Channel**: Removed automatically (iOS requirement)

## Troubleshooting

### If icons don't update:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
flutter run
```

### If you get errors:
1. Verify `logo.png` exists at `assets/images/logo.png`
2. Check image is at least 512x512 pixels
3. Ensure image format is valid PNG

## Current Configuration

The green color (#66BB6A) is your app's primary color, which will be used as the adaptive icon background on Android. This ensures brand consistency across all devices!

**Status**: Configuration ready - just add your logo image and generate!
